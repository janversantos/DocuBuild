## 💡 Pro Tips for Successful Trial

**Do's:**
✅ **Test with real workflows** - Use actual payment requests, site reports, etc.
✅ **Involve your team** - Get approvers and staff to test, not just admin
✅ **Try mobile access** - Many teams use this from construction sites
✅ **Check audit trail** - This is the compliance "killer feature"
✅ **Ask questions early** - Email me if anything is confusing

**Don'ts:**
❌ **Don't wait until day 6** - Give yourself time to test properly
❌ **Don't just browse** - Actually do a workflow (submit → approve → export)
❌ **Don't upload everything** - Keep under 100 docs for trial
❌ **Don't treat as production** - It's a test environment, keep backups
