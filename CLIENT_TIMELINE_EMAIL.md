Hi [Client Name],

Great news! I'm starting development on your DocuBuild trial today.

**Timeline:**
- **Development:** Oct 2 - Oct 23 (3 weeks)
- **Trial Launch:** October 23, 2025
- **Trial Duration:** 7 days (Oct 23-30)

**What you'll get:**
✅ Fully functional document management system
✅ Pre-loaded with 50+ sample construction documents
✅ 5 user accounts ready for your team
✅ All features: upload, approval workflows, audit trail, mobile access
✅ Login credentials and quick-start guide

**While I'm building (next 3 weeks):**
- I'll send you progress updates every Friday
- Week 1 update: Authentication + upload working
- Week 2 update: Workflows + approvals working
- Week 3 update: Final testing + demo video

**What I need from you:**
1. Confirm this timeline works for you
2. Send me 3-5 names/emails of team members who'll test the trial
3. List your main document types (payment vouchers, site reports, etc.)

**After trial launch (Oct 23):**
- You'll have 7 days to test with your real workflows
- I'll provide email support within 24 hours

Sound good? Reply with confirmation and I'll get started today.

**Questions?** Just ask - I'm here to help.

Best regards,
Jan Oliver Santos

P.S. I'm building this specifically for construction companies, so it'll have features tailored to your workflows (not generic file storage).
